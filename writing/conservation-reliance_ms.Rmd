# Introduction

Among the largest factors that affect biodiversity loss and extinction risk is habitat loss. The world is currently experiencing a biodiversity crisis, [@wwf_living_2020; @rosenberg_decline_2019] in which the biggest driver of biodiversity loss is habitat loss, with the destruction of natural areas driven in particular by agricultural expansion [@maxwell_biodiversity:_2016; @wwf_living_2020]. Habitat conversion is the leading cause of species extinctions among anthropic changes on Earth [@goncalves-souzaHabitatLossExtinction2020]. As demand for food increases as a result of population growth and eating habits, the climate and agricultural sector is expected to grow and develop as well. While improvements in efficiency such as increasing yields per area, decreasing waste, and shifting away from meat-based diets in some cultures [@tilman_global_2011; @tilman_future_2017; @williams_proactive_2020] will help some threatened species, many others will face further conversion of primary habitat - particularly in the tropics [@gibbs_tropical_2010]. Because habitat destruction is one of the most influential factors in species extinction and will continue to be a major threat well into the future as agricultural expansion and habitat conversion continues, preventing and managing habitat destruction is a central issue in conservation and ecology [@liaoModellingPlantPopulation2013].  

Habitat loss leads to habitat fragmentation and smaller habitat areas. This has a significant effect on a species’ risk of extinction, in particular when combined with stochastic effects. The amount of environmental variation a population undergoes is highly dependent on area of habitat. Because most environmental stressors are localized, a population with a large area of habitat benefits from the averaging effect of environmental effects that are not over the entire range, while populations with a small habitat are at a much higher risk of extinction because environmental changes are likely to affect the entire population [@lacyConsideringThreatsViability2000]. Habitat fragmentation increases the risk of extinction due to having smaller ranges and a lower proportion of suitable habitat [@crooksQuantificationHabitatFragmentation2017; @reedExtinctionRiskFragmented2004a], while habitat loss within a species’ range was found to be the leading factor inhibiting recovery for species in Canada [@kerrHabitatLossLimits2004]. Habitat loss, therefore, will continue to be a major concern in conservation.  

The IUCN Red List documents species’ current risk of extinction, based on thorough assessments of the threats that species face [@mace_quantification_2008; @iucn_iucn_2020], in which large amounts of data are assembled and evaluated by experts. Of the five criteria under which a species can be listed as threatened, several are directly or indirectly related to the amount of existing habitat available to a given species. The conservation literature has discussed in detail the issue of ‘conservation reliance’ [@scott_conservation-reliant_2010; @goble_conservation-reliant_2012; @scott_recovery_2005], in the context of species that are unlikely to persist without sustained conservation interventions, such as prescribed burning. However, a related but under-explored area of conservation reliance lies in the extent to which species are committed to their current Red List category (or worse), simply because they do not have enough habitat remaining for downlisting to ever be possible.   

Thanks to recent advances in the resolution and extent of fine-scale habitat maps, it is now possible to refine species’ distribution data for all species with both spatial range data and information on habitat preferences, allowing us to quantify Area of Occurrence (AOO) at broad-scale, in a standardised way [@brooks_measuring_2019;@santini_applying_2019]. Criterion B2 of the IUCN Red List directly relates to AOO to qualify for a Red List category, in which if a species’ AOO is below a threshold value and meets 2 of 3 conditions it qualifies for that classification (Cite?). While Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is the continuous boundary in which all known sites of occurrence are included, Area of Occupancy (AOO) is the area within the EOO in which the species actually occupies. EOO may include unoccupied or unsuitable habitats, such as incompatible elevation or water sources, and is therefore a less accurate measure of a species' habitat than AOO. With AOH for all threatened, terrestrial vertebrates, we can easily identify species with insufficient habitat. Comparing current AOO to the IUCN Red List thresholds reveals the species that, at present, could never qualify for future downlisting and can be classified as “No Exit Species” (NES).  

Without substantial restoration or other serious conservation interventions, these species are at significant risk of extinction if the population experiences a new threat or localized stressors such as environmental effects. Regardless of the other interventions we take - including captive breeding, habitat protection, invasive species removal etc. - these species will never recover without either habitat restoration or translocation [@salafsky_standard_2008]. Because these species can only uplist and never downlist in the future without habitat restoration, policy changes may need to be enacted to aid these species and prevent loss of biodiversity. The 30 by 30 goal to protect 30 percent of U.S. land and coastal seas by 2030 [@bidenExecutiveOrder140082021] and Goal 15 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity [@TransformingOurWorld2015] loss both will aid in the protection of habitat area for these species and prevent these species from uplisting due to habitat loss. Simultaneously, the Bonn Challenge to restore 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested landscapes by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030 [@BonnChallenge2016] allows for NES the ability to expand their area of habitat and improve in Red List category.  

Additionally, informed decisions need to be made by the relevant local stakeholders regarding whether it is possible and desirable to increase habitat area. The cost of conservation is considerable and particularly strenuous on organizations with limited resources and funding; a marine coastal restoration project reported the median and average costs for restoration of one hectare were around 80,000 (USD) and 1.6 million (USD) respectively [@bayraktarovCostFeasibilityMarine2016] while the median Individual Conservation Cost (ICC) for a cheetah is 6,898 (USD) and 3,140 (USD) for a leopard [@weiseFinancialCostsLarge2014].  If gains in habitat quantity cannot be achieved for the NES, we must then consider whether other conservation interventions are worthwhile purely as a means to maintain the status quo, or whether such interventions are a drain on limited conservation resources for species with no hope of recovery.  


# Methods

## Area of Habitat

To assess which species are reliant on habitat restoration (NES) we define habitat as Area of Habitat (AOH), which we calculated following @brooks_measuring_2019. In brief, AOH maps were produced for all threatened, terrestrial species in taxonomic groups that have range maps and have been comprehensively assessed by the IUCN Red List to at least family level (all amphibians, birds and mammals, but select families in the classes Magnoliopsida and Reptilia). Range maps were downloaded from the websites of the Red List [@iucn_iucn_2020] and BirdLife International [@birdlife_2020], and refined to AOH by retaining only grid cells that fall within the range polygons, and meet the species' habitat and elevation preferences as defined by the Red List [@iucn_iucn_2020]. All spatial analyses were conducted in Google Earth Engine[@gorelick_google_2017].

Following Red List assessment protocol [@iucn_guidelines_2019], we exclude habitats that are defined by the Red List as 'marginal' in their suitability, or 'passage' in their seasonality of use. As we are interested in the minimum habitat area needed to sustain a healthy global population, for migratory species we consider only the smaller of either the breeding or non-breeding range, in keeping with the Red List protocol [@iucn_guidelines_2019]. We do, however, retain habitat types listed with 'unknown' suitability or seasonality, because this likely affects many threatened species that are simply too rare or poorly known for such classification to be possible.

To identify cells with suitable habitat, we used the 1 km-resolution IUCN habitat types map for the year 2015 [@jung_global_2020]. Level 1 habitat categories refer to the broad categories of Forest, Savanna, Shrubland, Grassland, Wetlands (inland), Rocky Areas, Deserts and Artificial habitats, each of which contains finer level 2 categories, e.g., 'Forest - Boreal'. Where a species' habitat preference is given only to level 1, we conservatively assume that all nested level 2 categories are also suitable. To identify cells with suitable elevation, we use version 3 of the Digital Elevation Map from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM v3). All maps were resampled to 2 km, following @iucn_guidelines_2019, projected to a Mollweide projection to ensure accuracy of area calculations. 

To quantify the extent to which AOH is a limiting factor in decreasing a species' risk of extinction, we compare AOH to the fixed thresholds used by the Red List to assign species to the Red List categories. The Red List use five criteria for this classification, and species are assigned to the highest risk category for which they qualify under any of the criteria [@iucn_guidelines_2019]. Here, we are specifically referring to criterion B, under which species are classified based on their geographic range. The area of a species' range can be measured based on Extent of Occurrence (EOO) or Area of Occupancy (AOO). The former generally refers to the area of the smallest convex hull that can be drawn to encompass all occurrences of a species, while the AOO is the subset of the EOO where the species actually occurs [@iucn_guidelines_2019]. Thus, AOH is analagous to AOO and can be used in the same way, using the same thresholds [@brooks_measuring_2019]. 

For the three 'threatened' Red List categories of Vulnerable, Endangered and Critically Endangered, the AOH thresholds are, respectively: < 2000 km^; < 500 km^2; and, < 10 km^2. We categorise species as no exit if their AOH falls below any of the three thresholds. We futher require that species are at least 1 km^2 from that threshold, based on the assumption that 1 km^2 is a trivial difference that can be gained or lost easily, and is within the error of the spatial data. We note that when the Red List use these thresholds for classification, they additionally require that two out of three subcriteria are met. However, several additional metrics would be needed to assess these subcriteria (habitat fragmentation, and temporal trends in population size or habitat quantity or quality) [@santini_applying_2019]. Such classification is beyond the scope of this study, as we are interested not in automating Red List classification, but rather in the extent to which habitat quantity limits our ability to improve species' prospects. Here, when a species is classed as 'no exit', we are referring to situations where no matter what other actions we might take to address threats and improve outcomes for threatened species, their limited AOH means that no exit species will always be limited in the extent to which extinction risk can be mitigated.

In downstream analyses, we summarise all no exit species, as defined above, and we also explore the magnitude of species' reliance on habitat by calculating the difference between species' AOH and the next highest threshold. This difference is the amount of habitat that a species would need to gain to have any chance of downlisting to a lower category of extinction risk, regardless of what other conservation actions we might take. We explore both the distribution of these differences to threshold, as well as the upper quantile of species within each habitat category that are furthest from the next threshold - the 'extreme no exit' species. These are the species with the most additional habitat required to safeguard them from extinction, and thus the species most likely to require major and concerted effort to save.  


*** Add???

We also explore the difference between each species' listed category on the Red List and their habitat category. The difference is red list category subtracted from category as numerical values.

The number of no exit species within each realm is calculated, in which a realm contains a no exit species if that species is listed solely in that realm or cross-listed in the realm.

- we will need to add how we generated the maps


## Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were conducted in R Studio, Version 1.4.1103. 

In order to compare the effect of class, realm, and habitat category on whether a species is a no exit species, a generalized linear regression (GLM) with binomial distribution was ran on the data set that contained the number of species within each realm. 

To test the significance of class, realm, and category on the difference to next threshold, a linear regression was ran for each of the variables as the dependent variable and Difference / Max Difference as the independent variable. The independent variable divides the difference to next threshold by the max difference possible for each threshold in order to standardize the differences across habitat category. 

Finally, a Chi-squared test was used to test the statistical dependence of class and habitat category.
