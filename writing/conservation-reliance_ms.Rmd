# Introduction

Biodiversity is the foundation of ecosystem health, underpinning an array of ecosystem services [@IPBES] and conferring resilience to anthropogenic change through taxonomic, functional and  genetic diversity [@oliver_biodiversity_2015]. However, the world is currently experiencing a biodiversity crisis [@wwf_living_2020; @rosenberg_decline_2019], driven primarily by habitat loss. Across all anthropic changes on Earth, habitat conversion is the leading cause of species extinctions  [@maxwell_biodiversity:_2016;@goncalves-souzaHabitatLossExtinction2020]. Habitat conversion is largely due to agricultural expansion [@wwf_living_2020; @williams_proactive_2020; @gibbs_tropical_2010], and is therefore expected to continue to pose a major threat to biodiversity. As demand for food increases, driven by population growth and eating habits, the agricultural sector is expected to grow and develop in tandem. Improvements in efficiency, such as increasing yields per area, decreasing waste, and shifting away from meat-based diets in some cultures [@tilman_global_2011; @tilman_future_2017; @williams_proactive_2020], could help to abate habitat loss for some threatened species, but many will face further conversion of habitat - particularly in the tropics [@gibbs_tropical_2010]. Monitoring and managing habitat loss is, therefore, a central issue in conservation and ecology [@liaoModellingPlantPopulation2013].

<!-- P2 = link between habitat area and extinction risk; this should briefly touch on environmental stochasticity (environmental perturbations more likely to effect entire population), demographic stochasticity (sex ratio imbalance, inbreeding, loss of genetic diversity -> impaired potential for local adaptation), and edge effects (smaller habitat means more edge relative to interior, which causes additional problems)  -->

<!-- Excuse the shameless self promotion below... -->

Habitat area and fragmentation are directly related to extinction risk. Indeed, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) include habitat area as one of the five listing criteria for the Red List, according to which assessed species are placed into categories of extinction risk ranging from Least Concern and Near Threatened, to the 'threatened' categories of 'Vulnerable', 'Endangered', and 'Critically Endangered' [@mace_quantification_2008; @iucn_iucn_2020]. Ultimately, populations confined to smaller areas are more susceptible to stochasticity and edge effects. Most environmental stressors are localized, such that a population with a large area of habitat benefits from the averaging effect of environmental effects that are not over the entire range, while populations with a small habitat are at a much higher risk of extinction because environmental changes are likely to affect the entire population [@lacyConsideringThreatsViability2000]. Species with small habitat area are also more likely to be affected by demographic stochasticity, including a sex ratio imbalance, inbreeding, and loss of genetic diversity [@CITE]. Compounding stochastic effects are the stresses associated with the relatively high amount of edge in small habitats, including higher temperatures and easier access for poachers [@ewers_fragmentation_2013;pfeifer_creation_2017]. The isolation of small, fragmented habitat can also make it difficult for species to disperse elsewhere [@crooks_global_2011;haddad_habitat_2015], which is increasingly problematic in a warming world where species are on the move towards the poles and uphill [@mcguire_achieving_2016;@senior_global_2019]. 

Many species in the wild can only maintain a self-sustaining population with ongoing species-specific management interventions. These species are referred to as "Conservation Reliant Species" [@scott_conservation-reliant_2010; @goble_conservation-reliant_2012; @scott_recovery_2005]. We suggest that insufficient habitat area is a form of conservation reliance. The extreme vulnerability to stochastic and edge effects for species with too little habitat inevitably renders these species more dependent on conservation interventions to maintain viable populations. Moreover, regardless of the interventions that we might implement to maintain species populations at the status quo, we cannot hope to achieve species recovery and halt biodiversity loss unless existing habitat is robustly protected, alongside positive gains in habitat for habitat-limited species. 

Recently, the most comprehensive assessment of biodiversity to date estimated that X million species are currently at risk of extinction [@IPBES]. In post-2020 conservation policy, global players are seeking to strengthen efforts to tackle the extinction crisis [@CITE]. 

Post-2020 conservation policy 
A prioirty for post-2020 conservation policy quantifying habitat area for threatened species, and the subsequent  conservation reliance

<!-- * I expanded a bit more on the policy side but can definitely try to do more - we might want to talk a little bit about your vision for making it more 'upfront' in the paper. -->
<!-- * I also felt like Goal 15 of SDG was relevant to both 'categories' of species we are talking about here (because it is both reverse and halt). If you think otherwise I can move it to just the second category -->

For species that have habitats with a potential of becoming worse, which are the species with habitats close to uplisting, species need habitat protection in order to prevent further habitat loss and uplisting. The 30 by 30 goal to protect 30 percent of the world’s land and coastal seas by 2030 [@30by30_2021] and Goal 15 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is to halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss [@TransformingOurWorld2015] both work towards this goal. The implementation of these policies measures will aid in the protection of species’ habitat areas and prevent uplisting due to habitat loss. Other species have too little habitat to be able to improve, and are thus conservation reliant. Both Goal 15 of the SDGs and the Bonn Challenge to restore 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested landscapes by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030 [@BonnChallenge2016] aim to restore habitat area. While these objectives will aid in the restoration of some species’ habitats, other habitats will remain in need of restoration without specific efforts to restore certain areas. Species that are CRS due to habitat need to be identified in order to pragmatically allocate resources and optimally prioritise areas for habitat restoration. The cost of conservation is considerable and particularly draining for organizations with limited resources and funding. For example, the median Individual Conservation Cost (ICC) for a cheetah is 6,898 (USD) and 3,140 (USD) for a leopard [@weiseFinancialCostsLarge2014]. Identifying which species’ habitats should be restored by conservation organizations and countries committed to the Bonn Challenge and SDGs alike would have the largest impact by prioritizing species that would benefit the most from restoration. Furthermore, if gains in habitat quantity cannot be achieved for certain species, we must then consider whether other conservation interventions are worthwhile purely as a means to maintain the status quo, or whether such interventions are a drain on limited conservation resources for species with no hope of recovery.


<!-- P3 = given the link between habitat area and extinction risk, IUCN Red List use habitat area as one of the five listing criteria; since a species need only meet one criteria to be listed in that category, we know intuitively that habitat area has the potential to be a limiting factor for downlisting species on the Red List, reflecting the reality that populations cannot recover and expand if there is insufficient habitat -->

The IUCN Red List documents species' current risk of extinction, based on thorough assessments of their status and the threats that they face [@mace_quantification_2008; @iucn_iucn_2020]. Given the link between habitat area and extinction risk, the IUCN Red List uses habitat area as one of the five listing criteria under which a species can be listed as threatened, and several others are directly or indirectly related to the amount of existing habitat available to a given species. Because a species only needs to meet one criteria to be listed in a threatened category, habitat area has the potential to be a limiting factor for downlisting species on the Red List. This reflects the reality that populations cannot recover and expand if there is insufficient habitat. Using habitat area data, two related and important facets can be identified for species; one is how close a species is to uplisting Red List category (getting worse), and the other is how far a species is from improving in terms of habitat. While Extent of Occurrence (EOO) data had been used more commonly for species due to ease of obtaining, recent advances in habitat maps now makes it possible to refine species data to quantify Area of Occurrence (AOO) in a broad-scale, standardised way [@brooks_measuring_2019;@santini_applying_2019]. AOO is the preferred method for measuring habitat area, as EOO may include unoccupied or unsuitable habitats while AOO does not. Using this new AOO data allows us to identify species with insufficient habitat, species that are close to uplisting, and species far from downlisting on the Red List. 

<!-- P4 = in terms of habitat area, there are two, related and important facets: (1) how close are species to getting worse?; and (2) how far are species from getting better? It is timely to address both, given the updating of relevant policy frameworks. In the first instance, species need habitat protection to maintain status quo -> 30 x 30. In the second instance, need to identify the species that are conservation reliant to be able to pragmatically allocate resources and optimally prioritise areas for habitat restoration -> SDGs and Bonn Challenge -->

<!-- P5 = what we did -> to answer questions (1) and (2), and so guide post-2020 conservation policy, we capitalised on recent advances in availability of habitat maps to calculate AOH for all species within taxonomic groups that have been comprehensively assessed by the Red List, and compared AOH to the Red List thresholds under criterion B to identify the so-called 'No Exit Species'-->

<!-- * Should this final paragraph be longer? I am not sure what else to put here. -->

In order to identify which species have too little habitat that they are in endanger of uplisting Red List category and which species have too little habitat to improve Red List category, thus also guiding post-2020 conservation policy, we used the recent advances in availability of habitat maps to calculate Area of Habitat (AOH) for all species within taxonomic groups that have been comprehensively assessed by the Red List, and compared AOH to the Red List thresholds under Criterion B2. The species that have too little habitat for future downlisting from a threatened category can be classified as "No Exit Species" (NES). Furthermore, the subset of NES whose habitat areas endanger them of uplisting with only a small loss of habitat area can also be identified. 

# Methods

## Area of Habitat

To assess which species are reliant on habitat restoration (NES) we define habitat as Area of Habitat (AOH), which we calculated following @brooks_measuring_2019. In brief, AOH maps were produced for all threatened, terrestrial species in taxonomic groups that have range maps and have been comprehensively assessed by the IUCN Red List to at least family level (all amphibians, birds and mammals, but select families in the classes Magnoliopsida and Reptilia). Range maps were downloaded from the websites of the Red List [@iucn_iucn_2020] and BirdLife International [@birdlife_2020], and refined to AOH by retaining only grid cells that fall within the range polygons, and meet the species' habitat and elevation preferences as defined by the Red List [@iucn_iucn_2020]. All spatial analyses were conducted in Google Earth Engine[@gorelick_google_2017].

Following Red List assessment protocol [@iucn_guidelines_2019], we exclude habitats that are defined by the Red List as 'marginal' in their suitability, or 'passage' in their seasonality of use. As we are interested in the minimum habitat area needed to sustain a healthy global population, for migratory species we consider only the smaller of either the breeding or non-breeding range, in keeping with the Red List protocol [@iucn_guidelines_2019]. We do, however, retain habitat types listed with 'unknown' suitability or seasonality, because this likely affects many threatened species that are simply too rare or poorly known for such classification to be possible.

To identify cells with suitable habitat, we used the 1 km-resolution IUCN habitat types map for the year 2015 [@jung_global_2020]. Level 1 habitat categories refer to the broad categories of Forest, Savanna, Shrubland, Grassland, Wetlands (inland), Rocky Areas, Deserts and Artificial habitats, each of which contains finer level 2 categories, e.g., 'Forest - Boreal'. Where a species' habitat preference is given only to level 1, we conservatively assume that all nested level 2 categories are also suitable. To identify cells with suitable elevation, we use version 3 of the Digital Elevation Map from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM v3). All maps were resampled to 2 km, following @iucn_guidelines_2019, projected to a Mollweide projection to ensure accuracy of area calculations. 

To quantify the extent to which AOH is a limiting factor in decreasing a species' risk of extinction, we compare AOH to the fixed thresholds used by the Red List to assign species to the Red List categories. The Red List use five criteria for this classification, and species are assigned to the highest risk category for which they qualify under any of the criteria [@iucn_guidelines_2019]. Here, we are specifically referring to criterion B, under which species are classified based on their geographic range. The area of a species' range can be measured based on Extent of Occurrence (EOO) or Area of Occupancy (AOO). The former generally refers to the area of the smallest convex hull that can be drawn to encompass all occurrences of a species, while the AOO is the subset of the EOO where the species actually occurs [@iucn_guidelines_2019]. Thus, AOH is analagous to AOO and can be used in the same way, using the same thresholds [@brooks_measuring_2019]. 

For the three 'threatened' Red List categories of Vulnerable, Endangered and Critically Endangered, the AOH thresholds are, respectively: < 2000 km^; < 500 km^2; and, < 10 km^2. We categorise species as 'No Exit' if their AOH falls below any of the three thresholds. We further require that species are at least 1 km^2 from that threshold, based on the assumption that 1 km^2 is a trivial difference that can be gained or lost easily, and is within the error of the spatial data. Species that are less than 1 km^2 from the threshold are considered to have met the threshold. We note that when the Red List use these thresholds for classification, they additionally require that two out of three subcriteria are met. However, several additional metrics would be needed to assess these subcriteria (habitat fragmentation, and temporal trends in population size or habitat quantity or quality) [@santini_applying_2019]. Such classification is beyond the scope of this study, as we are interested not in automating Red List classification, but rather in the extent to which habitat quantity limits our ability to improve species' prospects. Here, when a species is classed as 'No Exit', we are referring to situations where no matter what other actions we might take to address threats and improve outcomes for threatened species, their small AOH means that No Exit Species will always be limited in the extent to which extinction risk can be mitigated.

In downstream analyses, we first summarize the taxonomy and biogeography of NES. Next, we explore the magnitude of species' reliance on habitat by calculating the difference between species' AOH and the threshold for downlisting. This difference is the amount of habitat that a species would need to gain to have any chance of downlisting to a lower category of extinction risk on the Red List, regardless of what other conservation actions we might take. We summarize both the distribution of these differences to threshold, as well as the upper quantile of species within each habitat category that are furthest from the next threshold - the 'Extreme No Exit' species (ENES). ENES are the species with the most additional habitat required to safeguard them from extinction, and thus the species most likely to require major and concerted effort to save. The biogeographic distribution of NES and ENES was determined by resampling species' AOH to a 0.25 degree resolution grid (approximately 30 km at the equator), and summing the number of NES and ENES occurring in each country [@gadm_2018] and zoogeographic realm [@holt_update_2013].  

## Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were conducted in R version 4.0.3 [@r_core_team_2020]. 

The degree to which species are constrained from future downlisting by current AOH was captured by the relative distance of AOH from the downlisting threshold. This 'proximity to threshold' measure was calculated as the absolute difference between a species' AOH and the threshold for downlisting to the next lowest Red List category, divided by the maximum possible difference. Thus, proximity to threshold is a standardised measure that accounts for the fact that thresholds between categories do not increase linearly. As an example, a species with 1250 km^2^ AOH has a larger absolute difference to the downlisting threshold (2000 - 1250 = 750 km^2^) than a species with 5 km^2^ AOH (10 - 5 = 5 km^2), but both have a relative proximity to threshold of 0.5. We used a generalized linear model (GLM) with a Poisson distribution, using the function `glm` in the `lme4` R  package [@bates_fitting_2015], to test whether proximity to threshold varied by taxonomic class, biogeography and absolute AOH. Model inference was based on Likelihood Ratio Tests, dropping each variable in tern and comparing the reduced model to the full model [@zuur_mixed_2009].
