Conservation Letters formatting guidelines:

Perspectives provide a forum for authors to discuss recent developments or ideas with broad and significant policy relevance to conservation. They should be forward looking and written with a view to informing non-specialist readers (thus should be presented using straightforward prose and avoiding jargon). Perspectives may be up to 3000 words in length and should contain no more than 5 figures and/or tables, and fewer than 30 references.

# Introduction

* World is currently experiencing a biodiversity crisis [@wwf_living_2020; @rosenberg_decline_2019]
* The biggest driver of biodiversity loss is habitat loss, driven in particular by agricultural expansion [@maxwell_biodiversity:_2016; @wwf_living_2020]
* Increasing demand for food as the human population continues to grow and develop, some of which will be met by improvements in efficiency (increasing yields per area, decreasing waste, shift away from meat-based diets in some cultures) [@tilman_global_2011; @tilman_future_2017; @williams_proactive_2020], but much of which will likely be met by further conversion of primary habitat - particularly in the tropics [@gibbs_tropical_2010]
* Habitat loss, therefore, will continue to be a major concern in conservation
* The IUCN Red List documents species' current risk of extinction, based on thorough assessments of the threats that species face [@mace_quantification_2008; @iucn_iucn_2020]
* Of the five criteria under which a species can be listed as threatened, several are directly or indirectly related to the amount of existing habitat available to a given species
* The conservation literature has discussed in detail in the issue of 'conservation reliance' [@scott_conservation-reliant_2010; @goble_conservation-reliant_2012; @scott_recovery_2005], in the context of species that are unlikely to persist without sustained conservation interventions, such as prescribed burning
* However, a related but under-explored area of conservation reliance lies in the extent to which species are committed to their current Red List category (or worse), simply because they do not have enough habitat remaining for downlisting to ever be possible
* Thanks to recent advances in the resolution and extent of fine-scale habitat maps, it is now possible to refine species' distribution data for all species with both spatial range data and information on habitat preferences, allowing us to quantify Area of Occurrence (AOO) at broad-scale, in a standardised way [@brooks_measuring_2019;@santini_applying_2019]
* Comparing current AOO to the IUCN Red List thresholds reveals the species that, at present, could never qualify for future downlisting
* Regardless of the other interventions we take - including captive breeding, habitat protection, invasive species removal etc. - these species will never recover without either habitat restoration or translocation [@salafsky_standard_2008]
* For these species, informed decisions need to be made by the relevant local stakeholders regarding whether it is possible and desirable to increase habitat area. If gains in habitat quantity cannot be achieved, we must then consider whether other conservation interventions are worthwhile purely as a means to maintain the status quo, or whether such interventions are a drain on limited conservation resources for species with no hope of recovery.

# Methods

## Area of Habitat

To assess which species are reliant on habitat restoration we define habitat as Area of Habitat (AOH), which we calculated following @brooks_measuring_2019. In brief, AOH maps were produced for all threatened, terrestrial species in taxonomic groups that have range maps and have been comprehensively assessed by the IUCN Red List to at least family level (all amphibians, birds and mammals, but select families in the classes Magnoliopsida and Reptilia). Range maps were downloaded from the websites of the Red List [@iucn_iucn_2020] and BirdLife International [@birdlife_2020], and refined to AOH by retaining only grid cells that fall within the range polygons, and meet the species' habitat and elevation preferences as defined by the Red List [@iucn_iucn_2020]. All spatial analyses were conducted in Google Earth Engine[@gorelick_google_2017].

Following Red List assessment protocol [@iucn_guidelines_2019], we exclude habitats that are defined by the Red List as 'marginal' in their suitability, or 'passage' in their seasonality of use. As we are interested in the minimum habitat area needed to sustain a healthy global population, for migratory species we consider only the smaller of either the breeding or non-breeding range, in keeping with the Red List protocol [@iucn_guidelines_2019]. We do, however, retain habitat types listed with 'unknown' suitability or seasonality, because this likely affects many threatened species that are simply too rare or poorly known for such classification to be possible.

To identify cells with suitable habitat, we used the 1 km-resolution IUCN habitat types map for the year 2015 [@jung_global_2020]. Level 1 habitat categories refer to the broad categories of Forest, Savanna, Shrubland, Grassland, Wetlands (inland), Rocky Areas, Deserts and Artificial habitats, each of which contains finer level 2 categories, e.g., 'Forest - Boreal'. Where a species' habitat preference is given only to level 1, we conservatively assume that all nested level 2 categories are also suitable. To identify cells with suitable elevation, we use version 3 of the Digital Elevation Map from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM v3). All maps were resampled to 2 km, following @iucn_guidelines_2019, projected to a Mollweide projection to ensure accuracy of area calculations. 

To quantify the extent to which AOH is a limiting factor in decreasing a species' risk of extinction, we compare AOH to the fixed thresholds used by the Red List to assign species to the Red List categories. The Red List use five criteria for this classification, and species are assigned to the highest risk category for which they qualify under any of the criteria [@iucn_guidelines_2019]. Here, we are specifically referring to criterion B, under which species are classified based on their geographic range. The area of a species' range can be measured based on Extent of Occurrence (EOO) or Area of Occupancy (AOO). The former generally refers to the area of the smallest convex hull that can be drawn to encompass all occurrences of a species, while the AOO is the subset of the EOO where the species actually occurs [@iucn_guidelines_2019]. Thus, AOH is analagous to AOO and can be used in the same way, using the same thresholds [@brooks_measuring_2019]. 

For the three 'threatened' Red List categories of Vulnerable, Endangered and Critically Endangered, the AOH thresholds are, respectively: < 2000 km^; < 500 km^2; and, < 10 km^2. We categorise species as conservation reliant if their AOH falls below any of the three thresholds. We futher require that species are at least 1 km^2 from that threshold, based on the assumption that 1 km^2 is a trivial difference that can be gained or lost easily, and is within the error of the spatial data. We note that when the Red List use these thresholds for classification, they additionally require that two out of three subcriteria are met. However, several additional metrics would be needed to assess these subcriteria (habitat fragmentation, and temporal trends in population size or habitat quantity or quality) [@santini_applying_2019]. Such classification is beyond the scope of this study, as we are interested not in automating Red List classification, but rather in the extent to which habitat quantity limits our ability to improve species' prospects. Here, when a species is classed as conservation reliant, we are referring to situations where no matter what other actions we might take to address threats and improve outcomes for threatened species, their limited AOH means that conservation reliant species will always be limited in the extent to which extinction risk can be mitigated.

In downstream analyses, we summarise all conservation reliant species, as defined above, and we also explore the magnitude of species' reliance on conservation by calculating the difference between species' AOH and the next highest threshold. This difference is the amount of habitat that a species would need to gain to have any chance of downlisting to a lower category of extinction risk, regardless of what other conservation actions we might take. We explore both the distribution of these differences to threshold, as well as the upper quantile of species that are furthest from the next threshold - the 'extreme conservation reliant' species. These are the species with the most additional habitat required to safeguard them from extinction, and thus the species most likely to require major and concerted effort to save.
