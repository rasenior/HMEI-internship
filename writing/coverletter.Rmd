Dear Editor ,

Please find the attached manuscript "No exit: the conservation reliance of species with little remaining habitat", for consideration as a Practice and Policy article in Conservation Biology. 
Given the continuing loss of biodiversity and habitat driven by habitat conversion, many species have been left with small and highly fragmented habitats. In turn, both demographic and environmental stochastic effects and edge effects increase the risk of extinction for species with small habitat areas. This pushes these species to become conservation reliant, with no hope for recovering without habitat restoration. Our study identifies those species that have so little habitat that they can never exit their threatened status without concerted efforts to restore habitat and are likely only to become more threatened without habitat protection, termed  “No Exit Species. 

Advances in satellite data have allowed us to create habitat maps and quantify Area of Habitat (AOH). This AOH data was then used to identify No Exit Species as species with an AOH below 2000 km^2, the habitat threshold of the Vulnerable category on the IUCN Red List. We also analyze the classes of the No Exit Species, the difference between each species’ AOH and the threshold for downlisting to the next lowest Red List category, and the number of No Exit Species in each country and realm. Through this analysis, we reveal many species have AOH just above the Red List threshold for uplisting (which we call “Extreme No Exit Species”) and certain regions like island nations and parts of South America have high numbers of No Exit Species. 

This study is important not only for the general contribution of AOH data for 3,869 species, highlighting the need for habitat expansion and protection, and also for the potential to aid conservation efforts using the list of No Exit and Extreme No Exit Species and knowing which regions contain a high volume of each. With the huge international efforts to protect biodiversity and habitat, this is the perfect time to organize and direct these efforts. There should be a specific focus on restoring the habitats of No Exit Species with extremely small habitats and ‘easy wins’ with habitats close to the threshold for downlisting, while Extreme No Exit Species are in great need of habitat protection to prevent uplisting. Our research found that a few key countries contain both groups of species, indicating that habitat restoration coupled with habitat protection in these areas would have a disproportionate benefit for conservation. Identifying key areas where habitat efforts would have the highest impact also allows for conservation organizations to effectively manage their limited resources.

Noting the impact of small habitat area on increasing risk of extinction and the influence policy can have on conservation, we believe this study will be of interest to readers of Conservation Biology. Our study identifies species in need of habitat restoration and protection, highlighting the significant impact a concerted and organized effort would have on preventing loss of biodiversity.
